            <h2>My first gamejam: Slother</h2>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Are you mad too when humans destroy our nature? If so slother is the perfect for you...</p>
            <h3>Keyfeatures</h3>
            <p>The keyfeature is that you can design your own map...</p>
            <h3>Experience with the GameJam</h3>
            <p>This gamejam was my first gamejam. It was hosted by my school and you had to make a group of 3 people. The biggest challenge was that we had to split up the tasks to work efficiently. My task was the coding for the tower shooting, the pixel art and animation. After a while we noticed that we clearly overscoped our project. Our solusion was to make scrap some ideas and focus on the raw core mechanics. In the end it is impressive what we managed to achieve in just 2 days. </p>

          <h2> My first small game: Manta Seas</h2>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p> Would you like finding treasure. In Manta Seas that exactly happens to you. But oh no the the treasure chest is locked. Now you have to get the key without dying from the hostile animals.<br></p>
        <h3>Keyfeatures</h3>
        <p>The game is a short prototype to an interesting gameconcept I came across. I added my own twist on the game. I made it take place in the water. And added new enemies to it that make an actual challenge and really fast paced.</p>

          <h3> Small Farm Diorama</h3>
          <p>That is my second Diorama. I put alot of effort in trying to make a story to this scene. It's not a bland showcase of things put into a scene. Alot of stuff tells a story. I think that is most important.</p>
          <h3> Artisan's Desk</h3>
          <p>The Artisan's desk is a showcase of my attempt in stylising stuff with a handpainted touch. I think for my first attempt the outcome was very good</p>
          <h3> Robuddy</h3>
          <p>My Robuddy is my first attempt on doing PBR textures and animations.</p>
          <h3> Moustache Kart</h3>
          <p>The moustache kart my next attempt with PBR textures and animations.</p>

        <p>The Solarpunk house concept is an house I designed with an game idea in mind. It shows a fictional solarpunk world with a secret hidden in the ground. My building reflects that two sided world.</p>
