              <p>
                  Hello! Iâ€™m Colin Berens, a creative designer and passionate game developer. <br>
                  I studied independent game production at the Digital Arts and Entertainment college in Kortrijk, which has shaped my expertise and fueled my passion for game development. <br>
                  I specialize in C#, Unity, Blender, Substance Painter, and Photoshop.<br>
                  I aim to create games that offer fun, memorable experiences, with a strong focus on crafting moments that players will cherish.<br>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
              My other interests are: Film, Technology, Aniamtion, Motorsports. 
              But movies are my favorite media besides gaming because it helps me to get new inspiration. Some movies have destinctive style that can really help in games. Also one really bizzare source of interest is music videos. I sometimes see music videos that are so crazy that I they give a creative spark.
              I really love technology. The see where AI can help an developer in the future it really interesting. However AI can't be used on the cost of the developers. I also love old technology and I also saved some old consoles from the trashbin.
              I really love animation especially 2D animation. I don't know what but 2D animation is so expresive and still doesnt look outdated. From Disney classics to Anime. Everything has so much personality.
              Also some other completly different interest are cars and therefore Motorsports. Maybe It comes from the fact that I grew up next to a Formula 1 Racetrack.
