          <h3>About the game</h3>
          <p>Are you mad too when humans destroy our nature? If so slother is the perfect for you to take revenge with the other animals in the forest. In slother your goal is to save your tree from the illegal lumbers. You can command the other animals, such as snakes, rabits, crocodiles and skunks. Also you can hinder the illegal lumbers more by placing logs in their way to make their way harder. <br>
            <b>The forest awaits you for your rescue.</b></p>

              <h3>Decide your fate</h3>
              <p>The keyfeature is that you can design your own map by using the logs and stones so the game plays different each time. It is also necessary to do that.</p>
              <h3>Experience with the GameJam</h3>
              <p>This gamejam was my first gamejam. It was hosted by my school and you had to make a group of 3 people. The biggest challenge was that we had to split up the tasks to work efficiently. My task was the coding for the tower shooting, the pixel art and animation. After a while we noticed that we clearly overscoped our project. Our solusion was to make scrap some ideas and focus on the raw core mechanics. In the end it is impressive what we managed to achieve in just 2 days. </p>

              <h3>Description</h3>
              <p> Would you like finding treasure. In Manta Seas that exactly happens to you. But oh no the the treasure chest is locked. Now you have to get the key without dying from the hostile animals.<br></p>
              <h3>Keyfeatures</h3>
              <p>The game is a short prototype to an interesting gameconcept I came across. I added my own twist on the game. I made it take place in the water. And added new enemies to it that make an actual challenge and really fast paced.</p>
