        <h3>About the game</h3>
          This game was part of my client project course. This game was about a cool way to intigrate QR codes that you can get from products with a game. Our client had the vision to make that idea reality and we made a prototype for that.</p>

              <h3>Experience with the Client Project</h3>
              <p> For the first time in my life, I had to make a game based on a third partyâ€™s concept. It was a great opportunity to learn how to satisfy a client and make sure the game met their expectations. <br>
              It was also my first time working in a team. I learned how to communicate ideas with other team members. At first, it was quite confusing that everyone had different ideas, even though we had agreed on clear mechanics. Still, it was fun to create the game and to experience a full production timeline.</p>
              <h3>My Role in the Team</h3>
              <p> I was the game designer for the project. I created all the game design documents and came up with ways to integrate the QR codes. Later in the production pipeline, I became more of an all-rounder. <br>
              In terms of art, I worked on the 2D assets, parts of the art bible, and some animations. One of the creatures was designed by me. From a programming perspective, I was responsible only for a simple algorithm to generate trees and bushes, as well as for the camera movement.</p>

              <h3>Experience with the GameJam</h3>
              <p>This game jam was a crazy experience! I was part of a team of five, and we had just 2.5 days to create a game. Honestly, this one stood out as a much cooler experience because we divided the tasks efficiently. 
                I worked on every aspect of the game. However I focused on sound, Unity integration, and team management. We did an astonishing job with scope management, which allowed us to finish the game perfectly on time with almost no bugs.</p>
              <h3>The Game Jam itself</h3>
              <p>This game was made during the Howest Digital Arts And Entertainment Game Jam 2025. This game won second place in the Community Award and first place in Jury Award. The people that played our game were especially happy with the overall fun this game provides.</p>

              <h3>How I made the game</h3>
              <p>Before making the game I got themes to make a game. For the game I made entire brainstorm process in miro with different concepts. Then I worked out 5 of the ideas on paper. After getting feedback I chose 3 concepts and made a proof of concept in Unity. I chose then the best what later became Fastnetic. I made a iterative process to refine the gameplay and the I started production</p>
              <h3>Production Process</h3>
              <p>The game was made by using the Unity 2D engine. I used pre rendered sprites by modeling in Blender. I made simple textures in Substance Painter. Additionaly the animations are also made in Blender </p>

          <h3>About the game</h3>
          <p>Are you mad too when humans destroy our nature? If so slother is the perfect for you to take revenge with the other animals in the forest. In slother your goal is to save your tree from the illegal lumbers. You can command the other animals, such as snakes, rabits, crocodiles and skunks. Also you can hinder the illegal lumbers more by placing logs in their way to make their way harder. <br>
            <b>The forest awaits you for your rescue.</b></p>

              <h3>Decide your fate</h3>
              <p>The keyfeature is that you can design your own map by using the logs and stones so the game plays different each time. It is also necessary to do that.</p>
              <h3>Experience with the GameJam</h3>
              <p>This gamejam was my first gamejam. It was hosted by my school and you had to make a group of 3 people. The biggest challenge was that we had to split up the tasks to work efficiently. My task was the coding for the tower shooting, the pixel art and animation. After a while we noticed that we clearly overscoped our project. Our solusion was to make scrap some ideas and focus on the raw core mechanics. In the end it is impressive what we managed to achieve in just 2 days. </p>
