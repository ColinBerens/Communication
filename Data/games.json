Honestly, this one stood out as a much cooler experience because we divided the tasks efficiently. I worked on every aspect of the game. However I focused on sound, Unity integration, and team management. We did an astonishing job with scope management, which allowed us to finish the game perfectly on time with almost no bugs.",

The biggest challenge was that we had to split up the tasks to work efficiently. My task was the coding for the tower shooting, the pixel art and animation. After a while we noticed that we clearly overscoped our project. Our solusion was to make scrap some ideas and focus on the raw core mechanics. In the end it is impressive what we managed to achieve in just 2 days.",
